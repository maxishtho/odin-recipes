      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pasta:</strong> What I love about this garlic chicken pasta recipe is you can literally use any kind of pasta that you like. I typically alter my recipe, depending on what kind of pasta I found on sale.</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken Breast:</strong> I typically use boneless skinless chicken breast; you could also use boneless skinless chicken thighs. It's entirely up to you, and whatever you prefer will be fine.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> Normally, I use a combination of garlic powder, Italian seasoning, paprika, salt, and pepper to add more flavor to this dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> You want a good quality olive oil to cook the chicken in.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> The butter helps cook the garlic and adds to the flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic:</strong> For best results, use minced garlic. I stick around to four cloves for this recipe, but you could always add in more or less depending on what you like.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> The tomatoes enhance the way the chicken pasta looks, but it also makes it taste extra hearty and delicious.</li>
        <li><strong>Spinach:</strong> Spinach gives you a boost in vitamins and minerals. You can leave it out if you want to, but I love the flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Heavy cream:</strong> The real star of the show is the heavy cream! It gives this chicken pasta a creamy texture that is crave-worthy.</li>
        <li><strong>Parmesan cheese:</strong> You can't really have an Italian dish without some Parmesan cheese, right?</li>
      </ul>
