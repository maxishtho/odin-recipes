      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pasta:</strong> What I love about this garlic chicken pasta recipe is you can literally use any kind of pasta that you like. I typically alter my recipe, depending on what kind of pasta I found on sale.</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken Breast:</strong> I typically use boneless skinless chicken breast; you could also use boneless skinless chicken thighs. It's entirely up to you, and whatever you prefer will be fine.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> Normally, I use a combination of garlic powder, Italian seasoning, paprika, salt, and pepper to add more flavor to this dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> You want a good quality olive oil to cook the chicken in.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> The butter helps cook the garlic and adds to the flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic:</strong> For best results, use minced garlic. I stick around to four cloves for this recipe, but you could always add in more or less depending on what you like.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> The tomatoes enhance the way the chicken pasta looks, but it also makes it taste extra hearty and delicious.</li>
        <li><strong>Spinach:</strong> Spinach gives you a boost in vitamins and minerals. You can leave it out if you want to, but I love the flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Heavy cream:</strong> The real star of the show is the heavy cream! It gives this chicken pasta a creamy texture that is crave-worthy.</li>
        <li><strong>Parmesan cheese:</strong> You can't really have an Italian dish without some Parmesan cheese, right?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How To Make Creamy Garlic Chicken Pasta</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>I don't know if you can make an easier pasta dish with as much flavor as this one. You'll need to start off by preparing the pasta according to the package directions. You want to cook it till it's al dente and not overly cooked.</li>
        <li>Then you'll take the seasonings and add it to both sides of the chicken breast.</li>
        <li>Warm up the olive oil in a heavy-duty pan using medium-high heat. Once it's hot, add the chicken breast and cook them for 5 minutes on each side or until it's cooked all the way through. After the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pan and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Using the same pan, add in the garlic and butter. Sautee for 1 minute or until the garlic is fragrant. Then add in the diced tomato and fresh spinach. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes until the spinach has wilted and the tomatoes have softened.</li>
        <li>Turn down the heat and add in the heavy cream along with the parmesan cheese. Use a whisk and stir until it is fully incorporated in creamy. Add in a little bit of salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta and slice up the chicken into thin slices. Place them in both in the pan and stir well. Serve, and enjoy!</li>
